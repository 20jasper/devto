# Pulling changes from forked repositories

## Why use multiple forks? 
Imagine this—you are working on a feature in an open–source GitHub repo with a few others. You don't have write access, so you will need to make forks. If everyone is comfortable, one person can make a fork and give everyone else write access, but that's not always the easy to coordinate. 

### Setting up a remote
Your teammate just pushed some changes, how can you pull them into your own fork?

First we need to set up a `remote`, which is short for "remote repository."
```git
$ git remote add 
```
